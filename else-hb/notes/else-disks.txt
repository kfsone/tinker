Dear Monad,

We need to increase ORE 
quality by 50 - 70 % to
be able to produce modifiers 
in a reliable manner.

Could we hire someone from
your staff who can improve 
the refinement program? 

It's way too bad at the moment, 
this won't do if we are to ramp 
up production and start 
delivering modifiers world-wide.

Refining process
================

The goods can be refined in 16
unique positions.

Currently the refine function
has a 25% chance of error
which will reset the goods' quality
at the current position to

Any effectively generated theory capable of
expressing elementary arithmetic cannot be both

that proves certain basic arithmetic truths, 
there is an arithmetical statement that is true,

Letter from Rolf: Orgryte 6 September 1920. 
Hi my love, how's life? Are you listening closely 
and eating enough? Ive been thinking about what 
you said. How come sound affects me so much? I 
think it just brings back so many memories... 

You and me practicing fishing in the meadow 
while the birds sing... The sound of gravel 
when you approached the house from the road...
Would always make me glad! And that's why I just
had to go here and collect some. I hope this 
letter and disk reaches you some day and 
that you can use what I found in youre future 
computer programs. I must admit I dont get it
with all this computers programing stuff but I 
know you love it... 
I just wish i would have found some of those 
music disks i was told existed here...
Maybe I'm looking in the wrong places.. 

Anyways, loads of love! // Rolf

I had to leave. It'll probably be a logn time bfore you find this.

Gotta go. Dug too deep, went too far.

And crept beyond borders. I have been destroyed.

MANUALS


===================================
THE BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO THE MODIFIER
===================================

*** Chapter 11: Comments ***

A comment in the code is ignored
by the compiler. You can create
a comment by typing the # sign.

Any text on the line to the right
of the # sign will be ignored.

Be helpful to your future self
and others - comment your code!




===================================
THE BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO THE MODIFIER
===================================

*** Chapter 5: Autocomplete ***

The section at the lower part of your
modifier ("help area") has a list of 
functions available to you when programming.

Start writing the name of a function
to limit the number of options and 
find it in the list of suggestions.

If you press the TAB key, the highlighted
option will be inserted into the code
with a starting parenthesis: (

When entering arguments to a function
the help area will show documentation
for each argument.



===================================
THE BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO THE MODIFIER
===================================

*** Chapter 4: Errors ***

When errors are detected, either
during compilation (see floppy 4)
or when the program is running,
execution will stop and the error
will be presented in the "help area",
the lower part of the modifier window.

In case of a runtime error it's
possible to start the program again,
either by activating the object
or by compiling the code again.



===================================
THE BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO THE MODIFIER
===================================

*** Chapter 2: The Compiler ***

A compiler is a program that takes 
source code in the form of 
text and transforms it into
something that can be executed 
by the computer.

If any errors are discovered
during the compilation step
they will be presented to the
programmer in the "help area",
the lower part of the modifier.

Jacyś ludzie

Jacyś ludzie w ucieczce przed jakimiś ludźmi.
W jakimś kraju pod słońcem
i niektórymi chmurami.

Zostawiają za sobą jakieś swoje wszystko,
obsiane pola, jakieś kury, psy,
lusterka, w których właśnie przegląda się ogień.

Mają na plecach dzbanki i tobołki,
im bardziej puste, tym z dnia na dzień cięższe.

Odbywa się po cichu czyjeś ustawanie,
a w zgiełku czyjeś komuś chleba wydzieranie
i czyjeś martwym dzieckiem potrząsanie.

Przed nimi jakaś wciąż nie tędy droga,
nie ten, co trzeba most
nad rzeką dziwnie różową.
Dokoła jakieś strzały, raz bliżej, raz dalej,
w górze samolot trochę kołujący.

Przydałaby się jakaś niewidzialność,
jakaś bura kamienność,
a jeszcze lepiej niebyłość
na pewien krótki czas albo i długi.

Coś jeszcze się wydarzy, tylko gdzie i co.
Ktoś wyjdzie im naprzeciw, tylko kiedy, kto,
w ilu postaciach i w jakich zamiarach.
Jeśli będzie miał wybór,
może nie zechce być wrogiem
i pozostawi ich przy jakimś życiu.

 
-Wislawa Szymborska

DO NOT TRY TO IMPROVE THE 
REFINING ALGORITHM ON YOUR OWN.

The rights to the algorithm are not
owned by us and any changes must
be signed off by me. I know that it's
not efficient and that creating screwdrivers
isn't exactly what we set out to do.

But please, I have enough problems with 
the Ministry as it is.

Hello El Huervo! It's been a while.. 
How is that tomato plant doing? 
I heard Kristian has Tomatos on his...

Anyways, this song is "AllAboutYouToo"

Crank that stuff up on your nearest 
jukebox. PlaySound and all that.. 

Loads of love from *Hello World*

WHAT GOD IS HE, WRITES LAWS OF PEACE

What God is he, writes laws of Peace, 
and clothes him in a tempest
What pitying Angels lusts for Tears, 
and fans himself with sighs
What crawling villain preaches abstinence,
and wraps himself
In fat of Lambs? 
No more I FOLLOW
NO MORE OBEDIENCE PAY

You've picked a very sunny and private place to grow

You have easy access to this space

You can bring water to your plants when needed

You're sure no one else knows about the spot. 
As far as privacy, try leaving a few $5 bills in the area, 
come back a few weeks later, if the $5 bills are still around, 
you have some evidence that no one else 
has visited this spot since you left.

The complexity is intense! 

It almost makes my head physically hurt! 

I'm trying to to line up the robots 
in favorable positions but it seems 
as if my opponent always knows what I'm thinking.  

I'm really "Confounded". I don't know what TO DO!!!

I don't even know why they thought it was Rouven. 
It'd take a totally different kind of character  
to dish out freebies like that... Only a true friend 
looks out for you even in the darkest of times.  
Old habits die hard.  A good gun will never "Rust".

            '-' => accumulator -= 1,

            '/' => accumulator /= 2,
