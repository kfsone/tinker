Python is my go-to langauge for any new project I'm starting, these days, because with the huge supporting library it is reasonably easy to quickly assemble a prototype.

I tend to work with iPython ("pip install --upgrade ipython") but I'm especially fond of notebook ("pip install --upgrade ipython[notebook]") for a very visual tinkering experience.

Python has some serious deficiencies. If you care about performance, it's the wrong language (http://bitbucket.org/kfsone/tradedangerous). But there are so many things that Python is a great way to *access*.
