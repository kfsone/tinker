I routinely create bits of code for myself or other people that I wind up shaping into something I use now-and-again. This stuff is often tutorial or learning material, ways to demonstrate performance anomalies or bugs, command line stuff, shell stuff, etc.

Rather than create a plethora of repos, I'm going to sling it all here - Bash, Python, C++, etc.
